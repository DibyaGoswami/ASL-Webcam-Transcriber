# ASL-Webcam-Transcriber
ASL Camera Interpreter is a Python application that recognizes a set of American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs from webcam input 
and converts them into readable text in real time. The project combines computer vision and hand landmark detection to support 
accessible communication in digital environments.
